On April 28, 2025, the Iberian penisula suffered the largest and widest power outage in its history. The proximate and contributing causes are still underinvestigation. This repo, sponsored by the [LEMUR Lab](https://lemuruniovi.com/) at [Universidad de Oviedo](https://www.uniovi.es/), is an central collection point for relevant data, publically-sharable data about the event.



# So what happened?
See ["Detailed Analysis"](detailed_analysis.md) for more...

_Our best timeline_
- 12:00pm CEST: First oscillations


# What do we _not_ know?
- The Spanish government insists that a cyberattack is not to blame. LEMUR believes that there are perfectly believable technical reasons for the outage, and thus we have no specific reason to question the government's assertion. Nevertheless, the generally public will not know the cybersecurity details any time soon, if ever.

# What can we infer?
- The Spanish grid was operating with 54% solar at the time.



# What would we like to know?
Help us tune our models! Here's a wishlist of data:

- High-resolution (<100ms) frequency measurements from any point on the Iberian or French transmissiong grid
- Very high resolution (<10ms) measurements of any voltage or current waveform from equipment that was directly connected to the grid before 12:33pm, regardless of connection voltage.
- Information about behind-the-meter/self-consumption solar PV and battery systems (ratings, location, any time series data)
-
